# JPACRUDProject


## Description
The Potato Project was made to be able to follow the basics of CRUD. This webpage boasts 7 different webpages, four of which represent the four aspects of CRUD, the other three are the home page, error page, and a page to search by keyword.

This potato displayer lets you see the potatos ID, the name, color of the interior and exterior, what the best uses of the potato is, as well as the description of the potato. Each one of these aspects can be manulupated with the editor button. This potato can be deleted from either the seach or the find by ID through the aptly named "delete" button. You can add a new potato as well and add each and every one of these aspects or leave a couple out, its truely up to you.

## Lessons Learned
What I learned through this new project was how easy it is to create a new website with the new technologies Ive learned. Creating the HTML, controllers, DAO and website set up is far more easy after a couple of repetions. With the transactional tag creating and adding new DAO implementors is far more easy compaired to writing every single sql query, binding the attributes to the entities and then saving them. I also need to be abe to add Javascript to my pages to create a far more visually appealing site.

	 
## Difficulties Encountered
	- Encountered HTML binding errors to the controler
	- Errors with fomating the HTML for proper iteration
	- Errors with CSS, this was my major issue so i did have to use ChatGPT to help out with this aspect. I will need a fair bit more practice when it comes to better formatting 
	- Had Issues the tranactional tag
	- Resolved Problems With binding Controllers  return JSP which were in subfolders 
	- Error Where description in the searched by Keyword JSP was far too condensed
